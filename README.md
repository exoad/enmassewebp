# EnMasseWebp

Convert those funky `WebP` images to a more recognized format such as `PNG` and `JPEG` en masse!

No more fiddling with online converters, just do it straight on your computer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is not discouragement against using the `WebP` format and instead just for users to convert the format to more common ones. This is especially as there may not be a decoder for some devices.
